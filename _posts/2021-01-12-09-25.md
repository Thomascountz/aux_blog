I designed the monophonic gestures using beepbox.co/. It's a simple tool to quickly prototype and export mp3. All gestures have C as the tonal center, this will hopefully allow major and minor notes convey positive and negative feedback. For example, the "alert" tone is a repetition of E♭. Without a C instantly present, it may not feel minor, but as the relationship with the device builds, I hope that the tonal center will be reinforced and allow for the E♭ to be felt as minor on its own.
