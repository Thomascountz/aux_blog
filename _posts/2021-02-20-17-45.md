## Beep
Aux communicates to the user via tone gestures. Think of the sound your phone or laptop makes when you plug in the charger or the sound your computer makes when theres an error. These tones are generated via a piezoelectric buzzer.

### Firmware
This beep prototype is written in Arduino-compatible C++ using the [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/). Pressing the button plays the [hello](/assets/audio/hello.mp3) gesture.

### Gestrures
See update [2021-01-12-09-25]({% post_url 2021-01-12-09-25 %}).

### Hardware
The circuit is designed with [KiCAD](https://kicad.org/) and consists the ESP32 dev board, a passive piezoelectric buzzer, and a momentary tactile button switch.
