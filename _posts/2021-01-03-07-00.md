## Questions

1. Can I use poster board to create a mold?

I probably don't want to do this... I can imagine the paper getting stuck to the resin, or worse, the resin saturating and leaking through the board.

1. Pouring multiple layers?
    - Wait until fully cured or add layer during "gel" stage?
2. Acrylic sheet molds?

Try PETG sheets: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ResinCasting/comments/aj83cz/i_feel_like_this_is_a_stupid_question_but_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResinCasting/comments/aj83cz/i_feel_like_this_is_a_stupid_question_but_this/)

Or Plexiglas: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ResinCasting/comments/hjdvbz/beginner_questions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResinCasting/comments/hjdvbz/beginner_questions/)

1. Vacuum pump?

Google: Break bleeder vacuum chamber

> Vacuum
In the home stabilizing field, anything from a hand operated vacuum pump, (for bleeding automotive brake systems) to a air conditioning service vacuum pump. The objective here is to create a vacuum of  around 25" of mercury or more, ideally 30".

> Chamber
For the most part, home stabilizing is done in sealed jars, such as a pickle jar. The resin and pieces of wood are place into the jar (aka chamber), the lid is secured and a vacuum pump is attached.

> Vacuum Degassing
The container holding the resin should have enough headspace to accommodate three times the original volume of the resin. Vacuum is pulled to 29 inches of mercury. The air is sucked out of the resin which causes the bubbles to rise up and then collapse. This process typically takes a couple of minutes.
