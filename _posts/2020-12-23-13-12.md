Resin was inspired while I was watching Felicia Day stream Cyberpunk 2077. What drilled itself into my brain, like a precision hypodermic needle injecting inspiration directly into the ether of my consciousness, was imagining what a futuristic consumer device would look, feel, and sound like.

In Cyberpunk 2077, there's something called a Shard. I think a Shard is kind of like a glorified USB thumb drive, but I like the idea of a piece of hardware with inter-changeable pieces that augment it's behavior...

I'm imagining a clear resin cube where you insert "shards" or "program chips" that allow the cube to sense different things like air quality, sleep quality, blood oxygen, motion, etc.
