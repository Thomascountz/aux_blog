I'm moving away from the original design of a cube with inter-changeable "shards". The more I imagine how I would use this, the more I think about how I would want both temp/humidity _and_ CO2/VOC _and_ PM2.5 to be measured at the same time, I wouldn't want to interchange these, I would want them measured together continually.

So instead, I'm thinking of having "prism" be a static device and _then I saw this_...

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/watchy_wireframe.png" alt="a black and white wireframe of the Watchy smartwatch with labels for the ESP32, accelerometer, real time clock, vibration motor, buttons, e-paper display, lipo battery, micro usb, and serial adapter." %}

As I continued reading about [Watchy](watchy.sqfmi.com/), I'm realizing how possible it might be for me to make a "smart" watch. I don't have all of the details worked out yet, but I think there are some cool features I could include, namely, a way to control "smart" devices from a watch and some sort of motion tracking and notifications. Early thoughts...

I'll outline these sensors/components in a later update.
