I briefly looked into an ESP32. Of course there's more functionality, but I really like the ESP-01 form factor and I don't imagine I'll need anything besides I2C on the two pins... We'll see!

Here's a sketch of some ideas. The shards will be attached via magnets and made of clear polyurethane resin. I recently come across the [ADPS-9960](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/apds-9960-rgb-and-gesture-sensor-hookup-guide) sensor, which is a module that can detect gestures. It looks very exciting!
