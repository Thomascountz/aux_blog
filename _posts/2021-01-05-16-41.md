The initial design of Prism is a clear polyurethane resin cube (ðŸš§ TODO: dimensions TBD) into which an ESP8266 is embedded. It's interfaces include an OLED screen, monophonic audio output, simple gesture recognition, and swappable shards which augment Prism's behavior.

In order to configure a Prism, you must attach a Shard. A shard instructs your Prism to collect or query data and upload it to a central web interface.

An example of a Shard is the `ENVIRONMENT` shard, which allows the Prism to monitor the temperature and humidity around the device (indoor) and query Tether for the temperature and humidity in your area (outdoor). Both the indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity is displayed on the OLED screen and logged to Tether.

Other Shards include `AIR`, which monitor indoor and outdoor PM2.5 values; `TIME` which allow you to set multiple timers, alarms, and stopwatches; `BLOOD`, which scans your pulse and blood oxygen concentration; and `LOOKOUT`, which alerts you to nearby movement (if your away from home, for example).
