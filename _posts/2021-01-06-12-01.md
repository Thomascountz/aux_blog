I'll need some new tools to get started. I've always wanted to build out a "shop" for myself; this seems like the perfect project to get that started on!

Some things that come to mind:

## Hand tools
- Craft Knife with 5 Extra Blades
- Self Healing Cutting Mat PVC A4
- Straight Tweezers
- Curved Tweezers
- 5.75" Needle Nose Pliers
- V-Notch Wire Stripper
- 15cm Ruler (PCB Reference)

## Digital Tools
- Digital Multimeter - Model 9205B+
- 6-in Digital Caliper
- Pinecil (soldering iron)

## Misc
- Silicon Solder Mat
- 100g 99.3%SN/0.7%Cu 0.5mm Solder
- 10 Tray Utility Box
- Desoldering Braid
- Zip ties 
- Clip On Double Glass Loupe Magnifier 3.3x
- Micro USB 3ft
